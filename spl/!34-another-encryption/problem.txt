Problem: Another Encryption.
Write a computer program, that takes three strings S1, S2, S3 as input. The program will encrypt the text in S1. The
encryption technique is: Suppose, a character is S1 is X. The program will then find X’s nearest matching character
(nearest matching character will be the character whose ASCII value and X’s ASCII value have lowest difference, in
case there are multiple characters, take the first one that appears in S2) in string S2. Suppose, the nearest matching
character’s position is N. Then, the program will find the N-th character in the string S3 (if N is greater than the
length of the string S3, rotate the value N) and suppose this character is Y. The program will then replace X in string
S1 with Y from string S3. In this way, all characters in S1 are replaced by a character from S3. The program will
output the produced string.
