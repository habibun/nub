Problem: Encrypt the CodeWord.
In earlier history, people often used different techniques to send messages so that only the intended recipient can
decipher the meaning. One such technique was to shift each character in a message by T positions. For example, if
the message is “Go to Hell” and T=5, then the converted message will be “Lt yt Mjqq”. Here, ‘G’ is shifted to 5
positions forward and the result is ‘L’ and other characters are similarly converted. Note that, if the character is ‘Z’,
then shifting it 5 positions will produce ‘E’ (which is a rotate in fact). Also note that, uppercase letters are kept as
uppercase and lowercase letter are also kept as lowercase.
Now, write a computer program that will take an input string S and an integer number T. The program will output
the encrypted text.
