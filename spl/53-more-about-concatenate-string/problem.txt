Problem: More about concatenate
Write a computer program, that will take two strings, S1 and S2 as input. The program will also ask the user for a
integer number N. The program will do the following:
If N<=0, then the program will concatenate S2, S1 to produce another string.
If N>=length(S1), then the program will concatenate S1, S2 to produce another string.
Otherwise, the program will insert S2 after the N-th character of S1 to produce another string.
Example input/output are:
S1=“MADAM”
S2=”mam”
N= -2, output: “mamMADAM”
N= 10, output: “MADAMmam”
N=3, output:”MADmamAM”
N=1, output:”MmamDAM”
